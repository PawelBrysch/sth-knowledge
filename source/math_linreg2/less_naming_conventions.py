# Synonyms for Confounding Variables and Omitted Variable Bias
# In the context of regression analysis, there are various synonyms for omitted variables and the bias they can cause.
# Analysts often refer to omitted variables that cause bias as confounding variables, confounders, and lurking variables.
# These are important variables that the statistical model does not include and, therefore, cannot control. Additionally,
# they call the bias itself omitted variable bias, spurious effects, and spurious relationships. Iâ€™ll use these terms
# interchangeably.
